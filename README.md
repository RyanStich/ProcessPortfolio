Week 1: Reflect

on textbook that you've read for another course -
what has worked, and what hasn't worked? 
What features would you like to see reproduced in our textbook? What should we avoid?

I've read textbooks in the past that feel like instead of being an aid and a guide to what you're learning, they try to completely take over.
I always felt like a textbook should be like a trustworthy sidekick to balance your learning. Something you can read a chapter of, perhaps multiple times
absorb enough information to feel comfortable taking on a challenge and then going outside your comfort zone knowing you can always fall back on the text
in a case of emergency. But the last CPS100 text we had seemed like it tried to hijack the entire learning process and had you locked into learning only
one specific way, there was no room for creativity or exploration within the book. it wanted you to follow this chapter and do this project. and then move on,
rinse and repeat. I would like to see our textbook have great explanatory articles with live examples of code, but i would also like it to have suggestive projects
and creative ways to continue your learning outside of the realm of the book.

Week 2: Research

In this week i had decided to take a dive into the Airbnb style guide, this was something that through watching youtube videos i had heard mentioned several times. Upon studying this style guide I found that there were already a few similarities between the way that I had been taught to write JS and the way that the airbnb style guide is shaped. With a few differences, in my time writing javascript I have been encouraged to make use of ESLint to clean up the structure and style of my code. Practicing and writing with ESLint eventually led me to conform to the style so strongly that I now just code as if I had it on constantly, although sometimes I don't. But within my research I had never known that you could tweak Eslint to conform to certain style guides, such as extending to the Airbnb style. Upon discovering that i found something that has now become one of my favorite ideologies & makes a lot more sense as to why companies use style guides instead of allowing each individuals coding style to shine through; 

“All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people contributed.”

In the summer i had managed to complete a few small scale freelance jobs with another developer who has a deeper knowledge of node.js than i do, and in that time one of the most frustrating experiences was pulling changes, wanting to make edits, but finding the code confusing to read; even with commenting and reasonable documentation. Coding styles can speak just as loud as words. One of my favorite choices of the style guide was the rule of not breaking a long string. This allows code to be more searchable and easier to work with, rather than having a long run on sentence broken into 5 lines.

Week 2: Reflect

I believe I have managed to do well in following style guide directions when given it in class. Rather than just blindly follow and nod my head I feel like I've actually taken away a deeper understanding for why style guides make so much sense amongst organizations. Following a style guide is certainly something i believe is beneficial to any coding environment and through this research i think that in my spare time it would probably be extremely beneficial to learn and even try coding with the airbnb style guide (using eslint) or even extending as far as the google js style guide.

Week 3: Research

For this week I've decided to research one of my favorite javascript libraries even though my skills within it are far from great. Three.js is a library and API that allows developers to create some pretty crazy 2D and 3D graphics that get animated in the browser without any plugins (utilizing WebGL) THREE.JS seems like its becoming one of the more utilized libraries (at least within the world of https://www.awwwards.com/) I ended up becoming fascinated with all the extremely in-depth animations and moving parts I would see when I was looking for inspiration for my own projects. From there I bought, what I think is the only available course right now on three https://threejs-journey.com/ and that's when things got extremely confusing. This course has opened my eyes to the insane amount of work and structure that goes into creating 3D art within such software as blender or maya. The fundamentals and code that go along with webGL are only really the surface level content. This course goes into details on the scenegraph, the placing of cameras, the manipulation of cameras, lights, shadowing, textures, mesh, physics, mathematics, etc... I truly never understood the scope and scale of how these things get built until diving in. The documentation is extremely well structured and is extremely clear, to those who know what they’re doing. The only issue is until I had purchased the course I had absolutely no idea what any of it meant. So I would say the entry to begin coding is probably pretty high, and a familiarity with mathematical physics certainly helps. One of my all time favourite uses of Three resides within the background of this agency website https://www.nightingale.world/

Week 3: Reflect

In my own projects I always aim to documentate my code well, but I find that one area I can slack in is within my code comments. Especially when I'm building out my own passion projects in my free time. I always assume that in the future I will remember exactly why I was writing a certain line of code and exactly what it will do, but the future me who ends up dealing with that code is usually less than impressed and a little bit confused. I have learned that coworking with other developers, commentation is arguably one of the most important things and one of the biggest time savers. Although it takes an extra 10 minutes when you’ve completed writing a script, it can ultimately save you hours of annoying pings and headaches that later follow when another developer is trying to make sense of what you’ve written.
