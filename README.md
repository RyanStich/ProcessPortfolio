Week 1: Research

Textbook Technologies 

Collaborative editing - https://docs.google.com/
Team Communication - https://slack.com/
Review & Grammar - https://app.grammarly.com/
Licensing - https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT

Since we're creating this project to be open source, with creative freedoms amonst users it would be best to use the MIT license
https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
This license is granted to the user given the current state of the software, stating that there is no warranty of any kind.

PRO'S:
open source
extremely permissive

CON's:
No warranty, if a student down the road chose to use this and the file got nuked they would have no way of continuing to read

Week 1: Reflect

on textbook that you've read for another course -
what has worked, and what hasn't worked? 
What features would you like to see reproduced in our textbook? What should we avoid?

I've read textbooks in the past that feel like instead of being an aid and a guide to what you're learning, they try to completely take over.
I always felt like a textbook should be like a trustworthy sidekick to balance your learning. Something you can read a chapter of, perhaps multiple times
absorb enough information to feel comfortable taking on a challenge and then going outside your comfort zone knowing you can always fall back on the text
in a case of emergency. But the last CPS100 text we had seemed like it tried to hijack the entire learning process and had you locked into learning only
one specific way, there was no room for creativity or exploration within the book. it wanted you to follow this chapter and do this project. and then move on,
rinse and repeat. I would like to see our textbook have great explanatory articles with live examples of code, but i would also like it to have suggestive projects
and creative ways to continue your learning outside of the realm of the book.
